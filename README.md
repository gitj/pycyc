pycyc
=====

Python version of CyclicModelling code originally by Paul Demorest and Mark Walker

See https://github.com/demorest/Cyclic-Modelling for the original C version

This is designed to be a library of routines to use interactively or in python scripts, not necessarily as a 
turn-key program.
